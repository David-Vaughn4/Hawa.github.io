# **Digital Portfolio – Oscillating Fan Project**

---

## **Research**

### **Description of final project choice, why chosen, and what a successful project would do (35/35)**

For my final project, I chose to design and build an oscillating fan. I selected this project because it combines mechanical motion, electronics, and programming, allowing me to apply multiple skills learned during the course. An oscillating fan is also a practical, real-world object that demonstrates how motors, linkages, and control systems work together.

A successful project would safely produce airflow, rotate side-to-side in a controlled oscillating motion, and operate reliably for extended periods of time. The fan should be stable, reasonably quiet, and easy for a user to turn on and off. Ideally, the oscillation speed and fan speed could be adjusted.

### **Attribution of project serving as inspiration (20/20)**

This project was inspired by several DIY oscillating fan and motor control projects found on **Instructables** and **Adafruit**. In particular, I referenced projects that used Arduino-controlled DC motors and servo motors to create oscillating motion.
Sources included:

* Instructables.com – DIY Arduino Fan Projects
* Adafruit Learning System – Motor and Servo Control Guides

These sources helped me understand motor wiring, PWM control, and safe power usage.

### **Description of how project is different than source (20/20)**

Unlike the reference projects, my oscillating fan design uses a custom-designed fan housing and base, created specifically for this project. I also modified the oscillation mechanism to use a geared DC motor rather than a simple servo sweep, allowing smoother and more realistic fan motion. Additionally, I focused on creating a compact, stable design that could be fabricated using Fab Lab equipment instead of off-the-shelf enclosures.

### **Design Specification Considerations document (25/25)**

I completed a Design Specification Considerations document that addressed:

* Safety (covered blades, stable base)
* Power requirements and voltage limits
* Material choices for durability and weight
* Size constraints
* Ease of assembly and maintenance

These considerations guided my design decisions and helped prevent issues during fabrication.
