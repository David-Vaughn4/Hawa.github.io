TOPO Mountain CNC Project
Project Overview
For this project, I designed and manufactured a Topographic (TOPO) Mountain using a CNC router. The goal was to convert elevation data into a clean 3D model and successfully machine it while maintaining detail, accuracy, and surface quality. This project helped me strengthen my CAD/CAM workflow and CNC troubleshooting skills.


Workflow
Design & Modeling

Selected a mountain profile/topographic data.

Imported and scaled the design into VCarve Aspire.

Converted contours into a 3D model, adjusting height exaggeration for clarity.

CAM Setup (Aspire)

Set material dimensions and zero point.

Created roughing and finishing toolpaths.

Selected appropriate end mills to balance detail and machining time.

Toolpath Simulation

Ran simulations in Aspire to check for collisions, missed areas, and surface quality.

Adjusted step-over, feed rate, and pass depth to improve results.

CNC Machining

Secured material to the CNC bed.

Zeroed the machine accurately.

Ran roughing pass followed by finishing pass.

Post-Processing

Removed the part from the bed.

Lightly sanded to improve surface finish and highlight contours.

Issues Encountered & Solutions
Issue 1: Loss of Detail in Elevation

Problem: Early simulations showed the mountain looking too flat.

Solution: Increased Z-axis exaggeration and adjusted finishing pass settings to preserve detail.

Issue 2: Surface Finish Quality

Problem: Visible tool marks after the first test run.

Solution: Reduced step-over on the finishing toolpath and slowed feed rate, which significantly improved smoothness.

Issue 3: Zeroing Accuracy

Problem: Minor depth inconsistencies during machining.

Solution: Re-zeroed the machine carefully and verified material thickness before running the final cut.

Project Summary & Reflection
What I Learned:

How to convert topographic data into a machinable 3D model.

The importance of toolpath strategy in achieving good surface quality.

How small CAM adjustments can make a large difference in final results.

What I Would Do Differently:

Spend more time testing toolpaths on scrap material before the final cut.

Experiment with different finishing tools to compare surface quality.
